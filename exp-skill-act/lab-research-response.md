Digital Evolution Laboratory at Michigan State university (Summer 2017 --- present)

* Current projects include using autoencoder-based methods to automatically generate evolvable genetic encodings for evolutionary computing and developing a framework for experiments investigating fraternal major evolutionary transitions.
* Received additional fellowship funding for summer 2017 to continue undergraduate work with genetic regulatory network models investigating the relationship between plasticity and evolvability; presented findings at the 2018 BEACON Congress poster session.

Otis C. Chapman Honors Thesis at University of Puget Sound (Fall 2016, Spring 2017)

* Conducted a review of evolutionary computing literature and synthesize a theoretical analysis of evolvability in collaboration with advisor Dr. America Chambers and reader Dr. Adam Smith
* Performed computational experiments with Genetic Regulatory Network models to probe the relationship between phenotypic plasticity and evolvability.
* Prepared and delivered general-audience oral presentations at NW Honors Symposium and at the University of Puget Sound. Received Roderick MacArthur Award for an Outstanding Honors Thesis Presentation.

Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) Research Experience for Undergraduates (Summer 2016)

* Designed and numerically evaluated an individual-based set of differential equations to model the foraging behavior of ants over uneven terrain, analyzed predictions of the model over various experimental conditions.
* Collaborated with advisors Dr. Jason Graham and Dr. Simon Garnier in the Swarm Lab at the New Jersey Institute of Technology to develop and execute project.
* Prepared and delivered oral and poster presentations at a capstone conference in Columbus, Ohio.
* Participated in seminars and workshops on mathematical biology coordinated by MBI at The Ohio State University.

NASA Undergraduate Research Scholarship at University of Puget Sound (Summer 2015)

* Designed, applied for grant funding, and carried out project to develop algorithms for automated extraction of mouse ultrasonic vocalizations from noisy recordings in collaboration with advisor Dr. Adam Smith.
* Developed and tested filtering algorithms inspired by the Sobel Edge detection method that, after being trained on human-annotated spectrograms of mouse vocalizations, distinguish between true mouse vocalization signals and background noise, achieving 75\% accuracy at 25\% recall.
* Presented results and methodology at a poster session on campus attended by faculty, summer research students, and other students.

US Department of Agriculture Horticultural Crops Research Unit (Jun. 2013 â€“ Jun. 2017)

* As a Biological Science Aide, collected data for patent applications, performed plant propagation, and assisted with field maintenance.
