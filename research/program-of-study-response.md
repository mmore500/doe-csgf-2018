First and foremost, my course of study will help me develop the technical skills to carry out my experiments.
The deep learning and evolutionary computing courses at Michigan State emphasize hands-on project work.
In particular, taking these courses this last fall, I learned to use the PyTorch deep learning framework and the DEAP evolutionary computing framework.
Working with frameworks for deep learning and evolutionary computing will be key to my research plan.
These frameworks will allow me to build higher quality software for my experiments more quickly and in a manner that, eventually, will integrate more readily into real-world projects that need automated deep learning architecture design.
Studying parallel computing --- particularly, learning about performance profiling --- will be key to writing efficient software that takes full advantage of the compute power available to me through the MSU HPCC and, therefore, success in my experimental work.

My course of study will also equip me to interpret my experiments, too.

Finally, my course of study will prepare me to bring biological inspiration and interpretation to my work.
so that I can better relate my to terms that biologists care about
