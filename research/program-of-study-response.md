First and foremost, my course of study will help me develop the technical skills to carry out my experiments.
The CSE 891 deep learning and CSE 848 evolutionary computing courses at MSU emphasize hands-on project work.
In particular, taking these courses this last fall, I learned to use the PyTorch deep learning framework and the DEAP evolutionary computing framework.
Working with frameworks for deep learning and evolutionary computing will be key to my research plan.
These frameworks will allow me to build higher quality software for my experiments more quickly and in a manner that, eventually, will integrate more readily into real-world projects that need automated deep learning architecture design.
Studying parallel computing --- particularly, learning about performance profiling --- will be key to writing efficient software that takes full advantage of the compute power available to me through the MSU High Performance Computing Center and, therefore, success in my experimental work.

My course of study will equip me to interpret my experiments, too.
Coursework in graph theory will aid me in selecting and interpreting the appropriate metrics to answer key questions about how variants of the NGS algorithm affect network connectivity, particularly aspects of network connectivity related to functionality.
Neuroscientists use graph theoretic measures like connection density, in/outdegree, cycle probability, etc. in conjunction with multivariate statistical methods like discriminant, principal components, and cluster analyses to assess and compare structure in biological neural networks.
STT 850, which teaches these multivariate statistical techniques in practice, will complement my previous statistical training in generalized linear model methodology from IBIO 851.

Finally, my course of study will help me bring biological inspiration and interpretation to my work.
IBIO 832 surveys the evolutionary history of nervous systems.
Learning how, in organisms throughout natural history, the nervous systems' developmental processes interact with environmental influences will help me more effectively abstract the process of biological neuronal group selection into my NGS-inspired algorithms.
IBIO 849, in turn, emphasizes class discussions of papers on foundational topics in the field of evolutionary biology.
Becoming more familiar with the model organisms, experimental designs, and ongoing debates that inform current thinking about the influence of plasticity on biological evolution will help me interpret and present my own work to a larger audience of evolutionary biologists in terms familiar --- and of interest --- to them.
