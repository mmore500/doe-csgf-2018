My course of study will help me develop the technical skills I need to carry out my experiments. CSE 891 Deep Learning and CSE 848 Evolutionary Computation (EC) emphasize hands-on project work.
From these courses, I learned the PyTorch DL framework and DEAP EC framework.
These frameworks will allow me to build higher quality software for my experiments more quickly and in a manner that, eventually, will integrate more readily into real-world projects.
Studying parallel computing--particularly, learning about performance profiling--will be key to writing efficient software that takes full advantage of the parallel processing power available through the MSU High Performance Computing Center.

My course of study will equip me to interpret my experiments, too.
Coursework in graph theory (MTH 881) and applied multivariate statistics (STT 850) will help me select and understand the appropriate metrics to investigate how NGS algorithm affects network connectivity.
Graph theoretic measures like connection density, in/outdegree, etc. in conjunction with multivariate statistical methods like discriminant, principal components, and cluster analyses are used to describe and compare connectivity in both biological and artificial neural networks.
STT 850 will complement my previous statistical training in generalized linear model methodology through IBIO 851.

Finally, my course of study will help me bring biological inspiration and interpretation to my work.
IBIO 832 surveys the evolutionary history of nervous systems.
Learning how developmental processes interact with environmental influences in nervous systems throughout natural history will help me ground my design and presentation of NGS-inspired algorithms in biological reality.
IBIO 849 emphasizes class discussions of papers on foundational topics in the field of evolutionary biology.
Discussing the model organisms, experimental designs, and ongoing debates that inform current thinking about the influence of plasticity on biological evolution will help me interpret and present my own work to a larger audience of evolutionary biologists in terms familiar--and of interest--to them.
